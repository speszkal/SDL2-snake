# SDL2-snake
Snake game made using SDL2.

## Installation
I didn't want to include the whole SDL2 library in the repo so if you want to play the game you'll also have to download SDL2 and setup it the same way i did. </br>

1. Download the `main.exe` file.
2. Install the `\include` and `\lib` folders from the 64 bit version of [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.26.5) to this path `.\libs\SDL2` and the `SDL2.dll` file to this path `.\` (the `.\` path is the current working directory).
3. Open the terminal, navigate to the current working directory and run `main.exe` (it's beter to run `main.exe` through the terminal, otherwise you won't be able to see your score or potential error messages.


<!-- Open the terminal, navigate to the current working directory and use the makefile to compile (if you dont have Make installed on your computer simply open the makefile in a text editor, copy the command from the file and run it in the terminal). >
